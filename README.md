# project3
Development of a Full-Stack Data Visualization Web Application for Interactive Exploration of Datasets: Analysis and Visualization of Sustainable Energy Trends (Project1)

# Why we choose this topic:

Global warming is a critical subject in today's world.
Understanding the different parameters in relation to this subject is very important for policymakers, governments, researchers, and the general public. 
This data analysis based on reel Data will help to explore this relationship and highlight its significance.

# Project Objective 

In the preceding project1  https://github.com/yosieph/Project1
, we provided recommendations for future research, including:
1. Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the diverse factors influencing the adoption of low-carbon and renewable energy sources, encompassing geographical, socioeconomic, and demographic aspects.
2. Evaluating the overall environmental impact of specific countries or regions.
3. Projecting future trends in the development of low-carbon electricity and its correlation with environmental factors.
4. Predicting the future energy demands in relation to potential climate variations.
5. Setting benchmarks for the adoption of low-carbon electricity and monitoring progress.
 
####  In this phase, our focus remains on the in-depth analysis of the gathered data, aiming to address the following research inquiries:
# Research Questions
###  1. How does geographical location influence the production and consumption of low-carbon or renewable energy? 
###  2. What is the impact of land mass on the production and consumption of low-carbon or renewable energy? 
###  3. How does climate change affect specific countries or regions in terms of their energy practices and policies?
